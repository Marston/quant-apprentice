# Quant Apprentice üìà

Quant Apprentice is an autonomous AI agent for sophisticated, end-to-end financial analysis.
This repository showcases the evolution of the agent through three distinct versions, from a simple
rule-based system to a complex, self-reflecting agentic workflow powered by Google's Gemini Pro.

## Project Versions

This repository is organized into three distinct, self-contained versions to demonstrate the project's 
development lifecycle. Please see the entry point notebook inside each folder for specific instructions and code.

### üìÅ `v0_no_llm/`

* **Description**: A foundational version of the agent built with pure Python, without any Large Language Models. 
It uses hard-coded rules for analysis and demonstrates the basic structure of an automated research agent.
* **How to Run**: See the `demo.ipynb` notebook inside this directory.

### üìÅ `v1_llm_linear/`

* **Description**: The first integration of an LLM (Gemini) into the workflow. 
This version replaces the rule-based logic with LLM prompts for tasks like news analysis and report synthesis, 
but still follows a linear, top-to-bottom script.
* **How to Run**: See the `v1_linear_agent.ipynb` notebook inside this directory.

### üìÅ `v2_llm_graph/`

* **Description**: The final and most advanced version of the agent, rebuilt as a stateful, cyclical graph.
This version uses LangGraph, incorporates a vector database for semantic memory (RAG), an expanded toolset
(SEC filings), and a robust self-critique loop. **This is the final version for submission.**
* **How to Run**: See the `v2_graph_agent.ipynb` notebook inside this directory.

## üöÄ Getting Started (for Final Version 2)

### 1. Set up Environment

It is recommended to use a Conda environment.

```bash
conda env create -f src/environment.yml
conda activate quant-apprentice
```

### 2. Create `.env` File

The agent requires API keys for various data sources. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and 
add the following, replacing `your_key_here` with your actual API keys:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"
NEWS_API_KEY="your_key_here"
SEC_API_KEY="your_key_here"
FRED_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running Tests

To ensure everything is set up correctly, run the test suite:

```bash
pytest src/tests/
```
