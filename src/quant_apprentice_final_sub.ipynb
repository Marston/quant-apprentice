    "# ðŸ“ˆ Quant Apprentice: Final Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 2.0: Agentic Graph Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook represents the final, self-contained version of the Quant Apprentice project. It implements a sophisticated, multi-step financial analysis agent using a stateful graph architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub repository for this project can be found at: [https://github.com/Marston/quant-apprentice/tree/main](https://github.com/Marston/quant-apprentice/tree/main)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Agentic Capabilities Demonstrated:\n",
    "- **Planning & Execution**: The agent follows a multi-node graph that defines a clear, repeatable research plan (see Section 4).\n",
    "- **Dynamic Tool Use**: It leverages external APIs for real-time financial, news, and SEC filing data (see Section 3.1).\n",
    "- **Self-Reflection**: It uses an explicit Evaluator-Optimizer loop within the graph to critique and refine its own analysis (see Section 4, `evaluate_report_node` and `should_refine_or_end`).\n",
    "- **Learning (Memory)**: It incorporates a vector database (ChromaDB) to perform semantic searches on past analyses, demonstrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern (see Section 3.2 and graph nodes `retrieve_from_memory_node`, `save_to_memory_node`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agentic Workflow Patterns Implemented:\n",
    "1.  **Prompt Chaining**: The `analyze_article_chain` function processes raw news into structured JSON (see Section 3.3).\n",
    "2.  **Task Routing**: The `route_and_execute_task` function directs data to specialized analyst prompts (see Section 4).\n",
    "3.  **Evaluator-Optimizer Loop**: The graph's conditional edge (`should_refine_or_end`) and refinement loop embody this pattern (see Section 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains all necessary code to run the agent. Simply install the dependencies, add your API keys, and execute the cells in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of AI\n",
    "This project was developed with the assistance of an AI tool (Gemini). However, its use was strictly as a productivity and learning aid. Every line of code, design choice, and piece of documentation was 100% human-guided, edited, and rigorously reviewed by me. The AI was prompted for suggestions and explanations, which were explored until fully understood. This iterative learning process is demonstrated by the development of three distinct versions of the application, each built from the ground up to solidify my comprehension."

       "Here is the revised and final investment report.\n",

       "***\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Final Investment Report: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**\n",
       "\n",
       "**To:** Investment Committee\n",
       "**From:** Chief Investment Strategist\n",
       "**Date:** October 26, 2023\n",
       "**Subject:** **Revised Recommendation for NVIDIA (NVDA) to HOLD**\n",
       "\n",
       "### **1. Executive Summary**\n",
       "\n",
       "Following a comprehensive review incorporating quantitative analysis, market intelligence, and a rigorous risk assessment, our official recommendation for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is being revised from BUY to **HOLD**.\n",
       "\n",
       "NVIDIA remains a generational market leader with exceptional financial health and a commanding position in the artificial intelligence secular growth trend. However, the Risk Manager's review correctly identified critical flaws in our initial thesis. The current valuation appears to fully price in sustained, near-perfect execution of its core data center business. At these levels, the risk/reward profile is no longer compelling for the deployment of new capital. Our analysis concludes that the significant, known risksâ€”namely valuation, competition, and macroeconomic headwindsâ€”are now balanced against the potential rewards, warranting a more neutral stance.\n",
       "\n",
       "This HOLD recommendation is not a call to sell existing long-term positions but a strategic pause on accumulating new ones until a more favorable entry point emerges or new growth vectors are de-risked.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **2. Revised Investment Thesis & Risk-Weighted Analysis**\n",
       "\n",
       "Our initial analysis correctly identified NVIDIA's strengths but failed to adequately weigh them against the considerable risks. This revised thesis provides a more balanced perspective.\n",
       "\n",
       "**A. Reconciling the Valuation Paradox:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The central conflict in our previous report has been resolved. The market's current valuation of NVIDIA (trailing P/E of 52.1, forward P/E of 44.5) reflects an aggressive, multi-year forecast for its established AI GPU business. In this context, the core business is indeed **priced for perfection**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Future growth vectors, such as a competitive CPU offering (Grace Hopper) and software platforms (Omniverse), represent **option value** on top of this core valuation. While potentially significant, these ventures are in earlier stages and face entrenched competition. Therefore, they do not yet provide a sufficient margin of safety to justify the premium on the core business. To claim they are \"not priced in\" while the core business is \"priced for perfection\" is a contradiction. The reality is the current price represents a high-conviction bet on the core business, with little room for error.\n",
       "\n",
       "**B. A Disciplined Framework for Evaluating Key Risks:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of dismissing risks with broad statements about market trends, we will assess them systematically.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Valuation Risk (High):** This is the most significant headwind. A valuation this high is acutely sensitive to any deceleration in growth or negative shift in sentiment.\n",
       "    *   **Mitigating Factor:** The companyâ€™s robust financial health, highlighted by its net cash position (Enterprise Value < Market Cap), provides resilience. Furthermore, if earnings growth continues to exceed already high expectations, the company could \"grow into\" its multiple over time. However, this remains an expectation, not a certainty.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Competitive Risk (Medium):** The news regarding Intel's foundry services validates NVIDIA's market power but also underscores the dynamic competitive landscape. Competitors (AMD, Intel, cloud providers' in-house chips) are aggressively pursuing this market.\n",
       "    *   **Mitigating Factor:** NVIDIAâ€™s primary moat is not just silicon but its deeply entrenched CUDA software ecosystem, which creates high switching costs for developers. Its strategic use of competitors like Intel for manufacturing also demonstrates a pragmatic approach to diversifying its supply chain and maintaining focus on its core design competency.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Macroeconomic Risk (Medium):** The current environment of elevated interest rates puts pressure on high-duration growth stocks. Higher borrowing costs can temper enterprise spending, and more attractive yields on fixed-income assets can pull capital away from equities.\n",
       "    *   **Mitigating Factor:** NVIDIA's negligible debt and strong cash flow insulate it from direct financing pressures. The AI build-out is currently viewed by many corporations as a mission-critical, non-discretionary expense, potentially shielding it from initial budget cuts.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Geopolitical Risk (High):** Heavy reliance on a single region for advanced semiconductor manufacturing remains a persistent, high-impact tail risk.\n",
       "    *   **Mitigating Factor:** The company is actively, albeit slowly, diversifying its supply chain. The engagement with Intel Foundry is a clear strategic step in this direction, though it will take years to meaningfully reduce concentration risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **3. Synthesis of Specialist Inputs**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Quantitative Analysis:** The data confirms NVIDIA's pristine financial health and its strategy of reinvesting nearly all profits for growth. However, it is this same data that flags the primary risk: a valuation that stands as a significant outlier, demanding flawless future performance.\n",
       "*   **News Analysis:** The Intel news is not a simple positive catalyst. It is a complex strategic move that highlights both NVIDIA's current dominance (forcing a rival to become a supplier) and the long-term threat of empowering that same rival. This supports a neutral, watchful stance rather than outright bullishness.\n",
       "*   **Macro Context:** The restrictive monetary environment acts as a gravitational pull on valuations across the market. For a stock priced as richly as NVIDIA, this context elevates the risk of multiple compression should its growth narrative falter even slightly.\n",
