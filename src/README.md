Quant Apprentice 📈Quant Apprentice is an autonomous AI agent for sophisticated, end-to-end financial analysis. This repository showcases the evolution of the agent through three distinct versions, from a simple rule-based system to a complex, self-reflecting agentic workflow powered by Google's Gemini Pro.Project VersionsThis repository is organized into three distinct, self-contained versions to demonstrate the project's development lifecycle. Please see the README.md inside each folder for specific instructions.📁 v0_no_llm/Description: A foundational version of the agent built with pure Python, without any Large Language Models. It uses hard-coded rules for analysis and demonstrates the basic structure of an automated research agent.📁 v1_llm_linear/Description: The first integration of an LLM (Gemini) into the workflow. This version replaces the rule-based logic with LLM prompts for tasks like news analysis and report synthesis, but still follows a linear, top-to-bottom script.📁 v2_llm_graph/Description: The final and most advanced version of the agent, rebuilt as a stateful, cyclical graph. This version uses LangGraph, incorporates a vector database for semantic memory (RAG), an expanded toolset (SEC filings), and a robust self-critique loop. This is the final version for submission.Agent Workflow Diagram (Version 2)This diagram illustrates the flow of data and logic in the final, graph-based agent.<p align="center"><img src="docs/workflow_diagram.png" alt="Agent Workflow Diagram" width="80%"></p>(The Mermaid code to generate this diagram is located in the docs/diagram_code.md file.)🛠️ Technology Stack (Version 2)AI Engine: Google Gemini ProAgent Framework: LangGraphVector Memory: ChromaDBCore Libraries: google-generativeai, langgraph, chromadb, yfinance, fredapi, newsapi-python, sec-apiLanguage: Python 3.10+🚀 Getting Started (for Final Version 2)1.

2. Set Up API KeysCopy the .env.example file to a new file named .env and add your secret API keys.cp .env.example .env
# Now, edit the .env file with your keys
3. Run the AgentOpen the v2_llm_graph/v2_graph_agent.ipynb notebook and run the cells to see the agent perform its full, end-to-end analysis.
